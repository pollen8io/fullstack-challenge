# Pollen8 fullstack challenge example

This branch of the fullstack challenge outlined in the main branch is designed to be a starting point for you to build on. It serves as the basic foundations of what we might expect from a submission, without all of the features we've asked for.

We encourage you to build on this scaffolded project, as it makes use of technologies we at Pollen8 heavily rely on. However, don't let this discourage you from creating yours from scratch if you have better familiarity with either a different folder structure or different techonologies! Extra points will *not* be rewarded whether you use this branch or not.

If you decide to use this branch, please fork it, and send us a link to your forked repository as your submission.
